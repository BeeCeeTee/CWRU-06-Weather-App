# CWRU-06-Weather-App

## I. Description
The goal of this project was to create a weather app which would show the current weather, as well as a five-day forecast using the OpenWeatherMap API. Users could input a city name, then the app would convert the name to latitude and longitude coordinates, then retrieve weather data from external servers and print it on the page. A user could see their history of previous searches and view the weather for those cities by clicking on the corresponding button.
